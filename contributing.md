# Contribution Guidelines

Please note that this project is released with a [Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct.md). By participating in this project you agree to abide by its terms.

## Submission guidelines

If you want to submit something new to this list, please ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

- **Only awesome is awesome.** Research if the stuff you're including is actually awesome. After all, it's a curation, not a collection. Only put stuff on the list that you or another contributor can personally recommend. You should rather leave stuff out than include too much.
- **Comment on why something is awesome.** Apart from suggesting a particular item for inclusion to the list, you should also inform readers why it's on the list and how they will benefit from it.
- **Pay attention to grammar.** Ensure your entry is grammatically correct, typo-free and has no Markdown formatting errors.
- **Stylize your entry appropriately.** Ensure all entries are consistent:
    - Entries should only exist once, in the most appropriate category.
    - Entry names are separated from entry descriptions by a dash (`-`).
    - Entry names and entry descriptions are capitalized, except when trademarks would disagree.
    - All entry descriptions end in a period (`.`).
    - Entries can be groups for related sub-entries, using indentation levels to show hierarchy.
- **Content must be in English.** Most awesome lists focus on English content as it is considered the "international" content. Anything non-English would already be hard to qualify as the "go-to" resource because the language then acts as a limiting factor. If a resource is the go-to resource because it is the best, it is also worth translating. If you have something like that, we'd like to know about it. Maybe we can channel the power of the community to translate it and make it available to more people.

## Using the GitHub web interface to create a pull request

In case you are unsure how you can submit a pull request, here's ohw you can do it via the GitHub built-in editing experience.

1. First of all, you'll need a [GitHub account](https://github.com/join)!
2. Open the `readme.md` file in the built-in GitHub editor. Here's a direct link to do so: [Open `readme.md` for editing](https://github.com/schlessera/awesome-wp-cli/edit/master/readme.md)
3. You can start editing the text of the file in the in-browser editor. Make sure you follow the guidelines above. You can use [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/).
4. Say why you're proposing the changes, and then click on "Propose file change".
5. Submit the [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) by clicking on the `Submit` button!

## Updating your Pull Request

Sometimes, a maintainer of an awesome list will ask you to edit your Pull Request before it is included. This is normally due to spelling errors or because your PR didn't match the awesome-* list guidelines.

[Here](https://github.com/RichardLitt/knowledge/blob/master/github/amending-a-commit-guide.md) is a write up on how to change a Pull Request, and the different ways you can do that.
